            <p> I am 14 years old and studying in the 10th standard in Mary Immaculate Girl's High School, Borivali(West).<br>

                <p>At the age of six I was with my football kit on the ground trying to learn the skill of football, it was a new and great experience which I had experienced. Till the age of 9, I learnt how to dribble, nutmeg the players, fakeshot, stepovers, v-cut and many more.<br><br>

                     At the age of 9, I explored the world of athletics, where I had to build my stamina and speed. I worked hard to gain my speed and stamina and won many medals and trophies representing many local clubs in my area as well as my school.<br><br>
                
                At the age of 12, I moved back to playing football, since I had improved on my speed and stamina, this game became very enjoyable and I excelled by scoring many goals and representing my school and other local clubs.<br><br>

                I've also shown interest in learning the preparation of cakes and pastries. <br><br><br><br><br>
    Mathematics has been one of my favourite subjects which helps me to easily code and calculate faster.</p>
